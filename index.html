                            Nothing remotely like the Eiffel Tower had ever been built; The tower itself is 300 metres
                            The Eiffel Tower was initially built to serve as the entrance gateway to the International
                            Exposition of 1889 as well as a testament to French industrial ingenuity.
                            It has since come to represent the distinct character of the city of Paris.
                            Its lights are also often turned on or off to reflect commemoration of major world events.

                            for its size, antiquity, and architectural interest. Notre-Dame lies at the eastern end
                            of the Île de la Cité and was built on the ruins of two earlier churches, which were
                            themselves
                            predated by a Gallo-Roman temple dedicated to Jupiter.
                            The cathedral was initiated by Maurice de Sully.

                            As much as I delight in the creativity and innovation of Parisian chefs, there are times
                            when
                            all I want is a good old-fashioned French bistro meal ordered from a menu that needs no
                            explaining; personally, I find the recent Paris trend towards cartes with cryptic,
                            single-line
                            lists of ingredients – e.g. chicken, beets, herbs – unhelpful, provoking a peevish start to

                        There is a total of 29,901 kilometres (18,580 mi) of railway in France, mostly operated by SNCF
                        (Société nationale des chemins de fer français), the French national railway company. Like the
                        road system, the French railways are subsidised by the state, receiving €13.2 billion in
                        2013.[2] The railway system is a small portion of total travel, accounting for less than 10% of
                        passenger travel.

                        Among the airspace governance authorities active in France, one is Aéroports de Paris, which has
                        authority over the Paris region, managing 14 airports including the two busiest in France,
                        Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport. The former, located in Roissy near Paris, is the
                        fifth busiest airport in the world with 60 million passenger movements in 2008, and France's
                        primary international airport, serving over 100 airlines.
